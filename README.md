## Nearby Affiliates
This is as simple piece of code which gets a list of affiliates from an input file and calculates the affiliates which are living within 100KM of office location. The code uses [the Great Circle Distance formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) to calculate the distance between two points.

The input file is located at `storage/app` directory. The project uses an interface to get the results. The interface s binded to `AffiliateData.php` service, which reads the data from the file, through a service provider.

### Start the project

To start the project, simply clone this repository and run

`composer update`

And run the following command in the following:

`php artisan serve`

And open

`http://localhost:8000`

In your browser to view the result page (Don't blame me, I am not stylish in designing web pages at all xD).

To test the project, simply execute `php artisan test`.

All distances inside the project are in Meters.

### Improvements
Error handling can be added to the methods in service classes. This is not added because right now, only processing the given text file without any alterations was desired.

In addition, we can add an API endpoint to receive the input file and output the nearby affiliates. After applying this improvement, we can add a new feature test to test the API.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
